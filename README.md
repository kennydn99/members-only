# members-only

In this project I'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This is an opportunity for me to practice using authentication skills and database skills.

This is a project from The Odin Project.
